# ElectionAutomation
Automation of Cambridge 105 Radio's overnight election coverage

This repository contains the code files for running overnight election coverage. The idea is that correspondents at the counts have access to a Dropbox folder, where they file their reports. These are then automatically played out during overnight automation, accompanied by a few pre-recorded phrases.

## Pre-requisites
* ffmpeg
* MP3WRAP
* Liquidsoap
* Icecast server
Tested on Ubuntu 16.04
